Getting and Cleanng Data

The project uses data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Human Activity Recognition and Smart Phone Data site http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones:
Data for the project can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Variables: 
      activity_labels = six activity codes and corresponding activity names
      features = feature names for X_test, X_train

      subject_test = test set subject number, 1-30
      X_test = test set feature measurements
      y_test = test set activity, coded 1-6

      Subject_train = train set subject number, 1-30
      X_train = train set feature measurements
      y_train = train set activity, coded 1-6

      Variables: Combined data sets
      test = subject_test, y_test, X_test combined, by columns
      train = subject_train, y_train, X_train combined, by columns
      dataset = test, train, combined by rows

      Variables: Column names
      allnames = set of names corresponding to fullSet, not yet applied
      meanstdcolumns = subject, activity, and all features with mean or standard deviation
      reducedset = fullSet subsetted with meanStdColumns
      newnames = allNames subsetted with meanstdcolumns, renamed; applied to reducedset

      Variables: Tidy data set
      tidydataset = data set with average of each variable, by activity, by subject
